# EdpuzzleTweak
This Edpuzzle Tweaks!
The first program of its kind designed to speed up those videos on concepts you already know!


Guide:
  Simply click on the .exe file and start the video 
you want to speed up. Then use the keystroke Ctrl+J 
and that's all!

One thing to make sure is that this will only skip about 100 seconds, if you want to skip more press 
Ctrl+J again. It will repeat. Make sure you are still in the tab or it will not work!

Hope you enjoy this program. :)
